# Running-Game-Pygame
Simple game developed with pygame where the user clicks the left and right arrow keys repeatedly to win. This is great for persons learning pygame as it has a start page, gameover logic, background audio etc. Except major updates coming soon with this. Didn't have much time due to my finals coming up
